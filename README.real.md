# pager_duty_openapi_client

README.md is auto-generated by openapi-generator-client, so this README
contains Oilcan-specific instructions.

## Requirements

You'll need `openapi-generator-client` on your PATH. If you're using
nix, this is already included in flake.nix.

```
brew install openapi-generator-client
```

## Schema updates: openapiv3.json

https://github.com/PagerDuty/api-schema contains the OpenAPI schema
for PagerDuty's various APIs. `bin/update-openapi-schema` pulls the
latest schema for the PD REST API and writes it to `openapiv3.json`.

## Client generation

`bin/generate-client` calls `openapi-generator-client` and splats
the outputs into this top-level on this repository.
