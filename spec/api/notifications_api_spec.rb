  # unit tests for list_notifications
  # List notifications
  # List notifications for a given time range, optionally filtered by type (sms_notification, email_notification, phone_notification, or push_notification).  A Notification is created when an Incident is triggered or escalated.

  # @param since The start of the date range over which you want to search. The time element is optional.
  # @param _until The end of the date range over which you want to search. This should be in the same format as since. The size of the date range must be less than 3 months.
